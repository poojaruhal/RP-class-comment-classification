## Python: 
- For Python, we used [ast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html#module-ast) to parse Python docstrings of the [selected Python projects](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4311839) and extract class comments from the given projects.
	The parsed class comments from each project are extracted as CSV and given in this folder.
